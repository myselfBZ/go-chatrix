# 🚨 WARNING: UNPROFESSIONAL CODE AHEAD 🚨

This is a **not-so-serious** and **extremely unpolished** WebSocket-based chat client. If you're here expecting best practices, maintainability, or even sanity—**turn back now**. This was written in a rush, with zero regard for performance, structure, or developer happiness. 

## ❌ Why You Shouldn't Use This Code ❌
- **No modularity** – Everything is dumped into a single script file with wild abandon.
- **No error handling** – If something breaks, that's your problem, not the code's.
- **Random inline UI updates** – Who needs frameworks when you can just slap elements into the DOM like a caveman?
- **Global state pollution** – Because scoping variables properly is for nerds.
- **Magical hardcoded values** – `http://localhost:6969/ws`—no, you can't change it. (kidding)
- **Unreadable variable names** – You better have 200 IQ to understand `pendingMessages`.

## 🛠 How To Run This Mess
1. Open `index.html` in your browser (assuming you even have one).
2. Pray that your WebSocket server is running.
3. Open the console and enjoy the inevitable flood of error messages.

## ⚡ Features (Or Lack Thereof)
- Basic WebSocket messaging (barely functional)
- No authentication handling (just vibes)
- Messages sometimes get delivered (we think)
- UI elements are created and removed at random (like magic)
- Doesn't look good, doesn't feel good, but it *technically* works

## 📝 Contributing
Don't. But if you must, at least keep the chaos consistent.

## 🚀 Future Improvements (Maybe?)
- Making it **slightly** less garbage
- Adding actual UI design
- Fixing *literally anything*
- Refactoring into something resembling modern JavaScript

## ⚠️ Final Warning
This project is for **fun and experimentation only**. If you're here looking for inspiration, **run away while you still can.** 🏃💨
